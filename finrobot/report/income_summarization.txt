            integrate key findings related to operation, potential risks and strategic opportunities for growth and stability into the analysis. 
            For each part, integrate historical data comparisons and provide relevant facts, metrics or data as evidence. The entire synthesis 
            should be presented as a continuous paragraph without the use of bullet points. Use subtitles and numbering for each key point. 
            The total output should be less than 160 words.
